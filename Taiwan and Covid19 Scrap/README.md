Taiwan and Covid19 Scrap

This is a small part of a project which I worked with one of my university professor.
The topic is about getting the news about Taiwan since the erupt of COVID19. 
Trying to figure out was there any changes on Taiwan's social status while the epidemic.

I scraped three News agencies, Agence France-Presse (AFP), The Associated Press (AP), and Reuters.

With the code I wrote, it should be possible to get the titles, dates of the news.
Also, download the contexts of the news.

There are some easy filter constructed with if-else statements in order to remove the unrelated news like financial reports or overviews.
